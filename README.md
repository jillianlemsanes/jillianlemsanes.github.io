## Overview
Hello, my name is Jillian. I am currently on a self-taught path to becoming a Web Developer. I found Front End Mentor and this is my first project using their designs. I used all HTML and CSS to code this project. I felt some parts of this was pretty easy for me to get through, and other parts of this challenge lead me to several questions about best practice. Please let me know if you have any critics or if you liked how I did anything in this project and the way I coded it. Being self-taught, I often struggle with knowing what the best/most efficent way to code something is. Thank you!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page(buttons for this project)

### Screenshot

## My process

1) I chose a design on Front End Mentor that I knew would help me practice flexbox and other CSS styling that I need to know.

2) I planned out my HTML first. I looked at each section of the desktop design to plan my HTML, looking at how I would need to use flexbox at bigger screen sizes and how this would work for mt mobile design.

3) I kept an eye on common themes in the design so I can re-use certain CSS classes. 

4) After planning my HTML out, I coded my HTML desktop first.

5) I coded my CSS mobile design first, after I was happy with my mobile first CSS, I completed my desktop CSS design


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to get the header background picture to overlap the header section. This was difficult for me as I could not get the image and hero section to overlap. I was able to get the desired look by adding a class to the header tag and setting the background image.

I was also having issues with getting my buttons to be fully responsive at a smaller screen size. After some research, I just decided to go with a media query for the buttons to shrink the font size and padding at a smaller screen size. Later, I watched a video by Kevin Powell on Youtube regarding responsive design, I believe a better way to have made these buttons responsive would be to use min(), max(), or clamp() for the buttons. I need to do some more experimenting to see what would work best. 


One thing I learned about flexbox: setting a width to my columns helped me get the look I was going for, especially using the space-between property along with width. 

Another new tool I started using during this project that was extremely helpful was the "inspect" tools on firefox. It helped me figure out why my elements were not reacting in the way I was intending/expecting most of the time. It was a holy grail for me. 

And of coursse, this is my first time using Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop so this project is helping me learn the basics of getting my projects onto GitHub. 



### Continued development

For future projects, I want to focus on semantic HTML. I noticed I struggled with knowing what tags to use on certain parts of the layout.

I would also like to focus on CSS fundamentals. I am signing up to take a class on CSS which should help me learn the behavior of CSS a lot better, so I am not having to guess as much. THe goal is to understand the way it works so I am not having as much unexpected behavior.

I also will continue to learn how to better use my containers and divs so that my CSS is much more smooth to write. I found myself having to go back and fix certain things in my HTML so I could style it correctly in my CSS.

I am going to watch some Youtube developers build a website from scratch as well. I think it will help me see different ways to approach problems and also alternative and more productive ways to layout my code to help prevent issues later down the line while I wrote code.
